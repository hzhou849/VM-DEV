To install vscode in raspberry pi
1)Open a terminal, run "sudo -s" and then this script (again, the script is open source):

2) then type ". <( wget -O - https://code.headmelted.com/installers/apt.sh )" 

3) after install you can hold the updates by disabling them using:
#OPTIONAL to roll back a build:
sudo apt-get install code-oss=1.29.0-1539702286

#And we also need to disable the automatic updates on this tool
sudo apt-mark hold code-oss
